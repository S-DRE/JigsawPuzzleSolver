# JigsawPuzzleSolver

A small jigsaw puzzle solver that I am making for a company technical test.

Note: IN PROGRESS. NOT COMPLETED YET. Any help is appreciated. 
It gives a solution for at least 5x5 puzzles, 
but not working for an 8x8 test I've made. 
Also, it should return ALL possible solutions, not just one.
